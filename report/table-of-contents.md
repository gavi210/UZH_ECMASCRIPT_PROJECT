# Table of Contents

- Introduction
  - General intro
    - Use of Javascript/Typescript is growing (statistic?) - also on server side
    - Use of serverless paradigm is increasing (statistic from AWS Lambda, reinvent this year?)
      - Serverless paradigm more or less means event triggered lightweight functions
    - Growth in IoT systems also aligns with this
      - Many devices generating a lot of small data
    - Interesting to investigate efficient solutions for supporting event triggered lightweight functions based on new technologies
      - Primary objective is to understand how they perform and how to optimize them
  - Project objectives
    - List original project objectives
    - How project scope was revised during project execution
  - Structure of report
    - One/two paras describing the contents of the rest of the report
- Review of different JS runtimes
  - Qualitative review
    - Mention approach and criteria
    - Include table with some commentary
    - Note how we shortlisted to two specific runtimes (and indicate why two made sense)
  - Quantitative review
    - Document short experiments and conclusion
    - Link to QuickJS performance results
  - Conclusion of review of different runtimes
- Technology introduction
  - NATS
    - What is NATS
      - Include summary of features
      - Why it was chosen for this work
    - Short intro to concepts and architecture
      - Topics, clustering, jetstream, kv and object store, security and access control
  - Deno
    - What is Deno
      - Summary of features
      - Why was it chosen for this work
